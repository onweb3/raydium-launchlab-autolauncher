## 🎭 Preset Token Ideas & Metadata Pack

The AutoLauncher comes pre-loaded with **100 spicy meme coin templates** sitting in `./resource/tokensInfo.csv`. Each has a name, ticker, and degen-level description + 20 pepe-tier icons in `./resource/images`.

👉 Wanna cook ur own flavor of memes? Just edit the CSV or let ChatGPT fill it up with fresh copium coin ideas. Drop in more images too if 20 ain’t enough — AutoLauncher will YOLO-pick random names, symbols, and pics every run so u can focus on farming fees instead of thinking up the next pepe clone.

### Example CSV format (easy AF):

```
name,symbol,description
Meme Coin,MEME,This token is hilarious.
Space Token,SPACE,Reach for the stars.
Dragon Gold,DGOLD,Gold of ancient dragons.
Pixel Pepe,PPEPE,A legendary green frog.
Lootbox Coin,LOOT,Open your fortune.
```

## 🧠 Big Brain Alpha Behind This

Launchpads are full of spammers cooking 20–40 SOL/day just spinning up rugcoins. [Proof here](https://www.devscan.tech/leaderboard/labeled). Most 3rd-party tools = sus, might be leaking ur keys.
This script = **100% open source**, pure SDK, no backdoors. Run local, stay safe, cook easy.

## 🪙 Fee Tax (Tiny Degen Cut)

I take **0.1% fee** on ur trades → helps me keep this repo alive + push new features.
Don’t like it? Fine, change `FEE_RECIEVER` in `constant.ts` to ur wallet. But pls don’t nuke it completely, bruh.
